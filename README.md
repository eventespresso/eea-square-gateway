Payments through Square are now available for Event Espresso. Event organizers in many countries all over the world can receive online payments for their event registrations using Square.

With Square an attendee will be able to pay with a credit, or a debit card while staying on your website.They won’t have to leave your website. Instead, they’ll see a secure imbedded form on your website where they can pay and see a confirmation of their payment and registration right away. No payment information like card details will go through your website. On mobile devices, attendees will pay on a page and then see their registration confirmation.
